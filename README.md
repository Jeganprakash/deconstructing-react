This code is creating a custom React-like library that utilizes a virtual DOM. The main object in this library is the `React` object, which has a `createElement` method that takes in a tag, props, and any children. If the tag is a function, it is invoked with the given props, otherwise, an object is returned with the tag and props, including any children.

The `useState` function is a custom Hook that simulates the behavior of the `useState` Hook in React. It takes an initial state as an argument and returns an array with the current state and a setter function. The current state is stored in the `states` array and the setter function updates the corresponding state and triggers a re-render.

The `App` component is a functional component that uses the `useState` Hook to manage its internal state. It returns JSX elements that are similar to JSX elements in React, but are not transpiled and need to be handled differently in the `render` function.

The `render` function is responsible for rendering the React elements (created by the `createElement` method) to the actual DOM. It takes in a React element and a container and creates an actual DOM element based on the React element's tag. It then sets any props on the actual DOM element, renders any children, and appends the actual DOM element to the container.

The `reRender` function is responsible for re-rendering the entire application when the state changes. It resets the `stateCursor` variable, removes the current root element and renders the `App` component again.

In this code, the `render` method is called initially with the `App` component and a container element with an id of `app`, and `reRender` is called every time the state changes to update the UI.
